Here are some clues for teachers that a student may have problems with comprehension:

He seems to focus on the "wrong" aspect of a passage; for example, he concentrates so much on the details that the main idea is lost.
She can tell the outcome of a story, but cannot explain why things turned out that way.
He does not go behind what is presented in a book to think about what might happen next or why characters took the action they did.
She brings up irrelevant information when trying to relate a passage to something in her own life.
He seems to have a weak vocabulary.
She cannot tell the clear, logical sequence of events in a story.
He does not pick out the key facts from informational text.
He cannot give you a "picture" of what's going on in a written passage; for example, what the characters look like or details of where the story takes place.
